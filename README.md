# Quantum-Key-Distribution
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a cryptographic quantum protocol which uses the properties of quantum mechanics to allow devices to communicate with each other. Quantum cybersecurity protocols can be proactive, meaning that they can detect breaches before any critical data is accessed.
